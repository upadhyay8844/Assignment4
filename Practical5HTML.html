    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely
    used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which
    Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link
    available on a webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML
    is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a
    text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to
    display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining
    the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so
    forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
    researchers.
